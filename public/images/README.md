# Logo Instructions

Please place your Hudson logo image file here with the filename: `hudson-logo.png`

The logo should be:
- PNG format with transparent background (recommended)
- High resolution (at least 400px width for best quality)
- The logo will be automatically sized in the navbar and footer

If you have the logo in a different format or name, you can:
1. Rename it to `hudson-logo.png`
2. Or update the image paths in:
   - `components/Navbar.tsx`
   - `components/Footer.tsx`
